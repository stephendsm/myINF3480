# Welcome to the ROS groupsessions

## Project ideas:
You are free to create your own project toghether with your group. The only requirement is that you use ROS and that the project is somewhat within the scope of the theoretical curriculum.

The fundamental idea behind the projects are "cumulative learning", meaning that we want your project to be uploaded to our github, so that future students can choose to continue your work. You can reserve yourself from sharing your work with future students by writing us.

Below are a few ideas for projects: <br/>
(__Note: The list does not represent the full scope of what you are allowed to do. Think out of the box!__)

* [Trajectory Assignment](https://github.uio.no/INF3480/Groupsessions/blob/2019/ROS/tutorial_for_basic_project.md)
* Controlled Movement using kinematics
  * Use the kinematic  equations to control the joints or tip of the robot. For example a controlled movement to a point. 
  * Control the robot with the keyboard.
  
* Figure Skater
  * Use the robot to simulate how rotational velocity changes with inertia when spinning on a frictionless surface.
  
* Dynamic Equations
  * Examine how to represent the torques/forces in the joints correctly mathematically, by experimenting with different models in simulation.
* Control Theory: PID tuning
  * Use our control interfaces to tune the PID controllers of the simulated robot.
    * Make the robot dance by tuning the joints to move at specified frequencies.
  * Create your own control interface.
  
* Use Track IK, etc
  * Use premade packages to calculate kinematic/dynamic equations for the robot. Google it!
  
## Numpy
* [Numpy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/index.html)

## FAQ:
* [How often do I need to source?](https://answers.ros.org/question/206876/how-often-do-i-need-to-source-setupbash/)
