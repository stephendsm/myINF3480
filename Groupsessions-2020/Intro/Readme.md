# Intro

Overall info:
* Sessions will cover the material introduced in the lecture from the previous week 
* Will focus on examples from lectures, exam exercises and assignments.

## Schedule:
* Introduction
* Links and joints (revolute and prismatic) in manipulators
* Manipulator types (articulated/anthropomorphic, spherical, cylindrical, cartesian, SCARA)
* Workspace definition/shapes
* Definition of Forward/Inverse Kinematics problems
* Slack setup
* ------Break------
* Formula sheet and math prerequisites: trigonometry, matrix multiplication, differentiation
* Recap of basic trigonometry
* Task 1.19: simple precursor to forward kinematics

## Slack - install + walkthrough:
* Starred items
* Thread
* @ for mentions and tags
* Channel details - Crustcrawler
* Bold white/red number
 * Feedback
* Ctrl-k
* Pinned items/channel details
* Notification settings
 * Set yourself away

## Math
Mainly there are three topics of math that you need to be good at for this course:
* Trigonometry
* Matrix multiplication
* Differentiation 

Trigonometry:
* Definitions of sine, cosine, tangent and their inverses: arcsine, arccosine and arctangent
* Unit circle: useful in finding sine, cosine and tangent values of angles
* Trigonometric identities: in the formula sheet
* Derivation of the Law of Cosines:

Matrices:
* Matrix multiplication is **not** commutative
* Matrices can only be multiplied if the inner dimensions match
* The dimensions of the result are the outer dimensions
